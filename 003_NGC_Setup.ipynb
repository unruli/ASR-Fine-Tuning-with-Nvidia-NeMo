    "The NGCâ„¢ catalog is a hub of GPU-optimized AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and data analytics software that simplifies and accelerates end-to-end workflows. It includes enterprise-grade containers, pretrained AI models, and industry-specific SDKs. In this class, you'll install various speech AI resources this way and you'll need an NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC) account and API key.  For more information on NGC, please refer to the [NGC Overview](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/gpu-cloud/ngc-overview/index.html#accessing-ngc-softwarehttps://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/gpu-cloud/ngc-overview/index.html#accessing-ngc-software) documentation.<br>\n",
