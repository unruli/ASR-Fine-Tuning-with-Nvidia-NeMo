# ASR-Fine-Tuning-with-Nvidia-NeMo
With deep learning, the latest speech-to-text models are capable of recognition and translation of audio into text in real time! Good models can perform well in noisy environments, are robust to accents and have low word error rates (WERs).

Build, train, fine-tune, and deploy a GPU-accelerated
automatic speech recognition service (ASR) with NVIDIA Riva and NVIDIA NeMo.

The models and datasets are often quite large.  To streamline the process, some of these have been preloaded. In that case, the original steps are documented.
