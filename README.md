Please review the summary of the course in the table of contents below, which lists the learning objectives for each notebook.  If you are unfamiliar with using JupyterLabs or need a quick refresher, begin with the [JupyterLabs](002_JupyterLabs.ipynb) notebook.  Otherwise, jump to the [NGC Setup](003_NGC_Setup.ipynb) notebook to enter your credentials so that you'll be able to download the containers and model files for the course. The NGC step is required before continuing to the other course notebooks.  In addition, if you shut down the course and return, you'll need to go through the NGC setup again.

Course note: The models and datasets used in the course are often quite large.  To streamline the process, some of these have been preloaded. In that case, the original steps are documented.
